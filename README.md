## Project Motivation

 The project focuses on answering the following questions on the Seattle-Airbnb Dataset. 
1. Predicting the suitable price based on the features of the room {property_type, room_type, no.of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms etc.}?
2. What is the probable price for a room based on the neighbourhood?
3. Which type of properties are common in each neighbourhood?
4. What is the effect of selecting "Strict" cancellation policy on the frequency of bookings?
5. What is the neighbourhood where the price is highest despite providing minimum amenities?
