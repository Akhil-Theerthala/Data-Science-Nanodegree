# Data-Science-Nanodegree
This repo contains all the data of my attempts to hte Udacity Data Science Nanodegree from June 2022- Sep 2022


In this repository, There are 3 main Folders. 
1. Concept progress and corresponding notes.
2. Solutions to the files in folder 1
3. Projects

I will try my best to keep the stuff organized and detailed, so that, it can be accessed neatly. 

In the mean time, I will **try** to add corresponding notes to each topics and add what I can understand and grasp from the nanodegree. I hope this would be useful to someone someday, but, the major reason that I am doing this is to maintain this repo for my future reference. I will also add the link to the entire notes soon, which will be updated throughout my journey of this nanodegree.
